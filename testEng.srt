1
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:07,777
THIS IS A TRUE STORY

2
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,904
The artist Louis Wain

3
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,864
made the cat his own.

4
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,825
He invented a cat style,

5
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,661
a cat society,

6
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,790
a whole cat world.

7
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:24,460
Cats that do not look and live
like Louis Wain cats

8
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,463
are ashamed of themselves.

9
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:30,841
But that is not
what is important.

10
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,303
What is important is that
Louis Wain devoted his life

11
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,223
to making
all our lives happier,

12
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,600
and cattier.

13
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:46,774
In doing so, he undoubtedly
raised up the cat in society

14
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,944
and he changed our world
for the better.

15
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,090
Aside from
its bizarre social prejudices

16
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,759
and the fact that everything
stank of shit,

17
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,804
Victorian England was also
a land of innovation

18
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,181
and scientific discovery.

19
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,934
Many of the worldâ€™s
finest minds
